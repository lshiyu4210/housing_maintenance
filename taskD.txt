1. Address: https://betaweb.csug.rochester.edu/~jhao3/login.php

2. Webpage Instructions: When you access the login page, there are two options: you can 
either enter the system by entering netid, or see all the tables in the database (required by
task D). If you choose the first one, there are three netids avaliable for student accounts (
jhao3, sliu89, emeng2) and two for staff accounts (tjames, wsmith). 
In the student account, you can write a maintenance report for any item listed in the 
page by clicking on the report button on the rightmost column. In the report, you have 
to provide the description and date. After you submitted the report, you can track it or
withdraw it by clicking on the "My Activity" button. 
In the staff account, you can see all the requests that you are responsible for. Once you've
completed a request, you can click on the Complete button so the status of the request
becomes completed.
To switch accounts, click on the sign out button to return to the login page.

3. Contributions: We all worked together on online sharing documents for the entire 
milestone. We all agree each of us contributed an equal amount of work to this 
assignment. Thus, each of us accomplished approximately one third of the work.
